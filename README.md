    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
      This website talks about TV shows that we enjoy that tackle important topics that are not given much attention to but very much need awareness on. We are making our website about this because we both enjoy watching TV shows, and we also want to spread awareness and give importance to the topics they talk about. These issues are being talked about through the depth of the characters, the plot, and the circumstances the character faced before and are facing in the shows.
